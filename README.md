# CausalKnowledgeTrace: Interactive Literature-Based Causal Structure Mapping, Graph Generation, Visualization, and Refinement 

CausalKnowledgeTrace (CKT) automates causal knowledge graph generation from biomedical literature. The system extracts causal relationships from SemMedDB, a database of semantic predications derived from PubMed abstracts.

CKT has two main components. A Python engine handles graph construction and causal identification algorithms. A Shiny web application provides interactive visualization and user configuration.

Users specify an exposure and outcome of interest. They can constrain the search by publication year, causal predicate type, and minimum number of supporting articles per relationship. CKT constructs initial partially directed acyclic graphs (PDAGs) representing causal structures between biomedical concepts. Users then edit these graphs interactively to remove unnecessary nodes and edges. CKT can export graphs and evidence from the literature for downstream analysis. 

Additional tools in the furtherAnalysis folder refine the exported graphs. These tools classify variables by their causal role relative to the exposure and outcome. They identify nodes within three causal steps of the exposure or outcome. The tools also remove extraneous variables and detect minimal adjustment sets for unbiased effect estimation. This includes adjustment sets that address butterfly bias, a form of sample selection bias in causal graphs.

The adjustment sets account for confounding while avoiding collider bias and selection bias. This architecture supports systematic causal inference in observational biomedical research. Researchers can explore alternative causal structures and test different assumptions about edge directionality. The tool facilitates hypothesis generation and study design for epidemiological analyses.

```

### Step 2: Install PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is required to store and query SemMedDB data. If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, please follow the installation instructions:

**Installation Guide**: [PostgreSQL Installation Instructions](https://chatgpt.com/share/692494d4-269c-800e-a5a1-96a9e469670b)

After installation, verify that PostgreSQL is installed correctly:
```bash
psql --version
# Should display: psql (PostgreSQL) 14.x or higher
```

### Step 3: PostgreSQL Database Setup for SemMedDB

#### Database Download

We created a modified version of [SemMedDB](https://skr3.nlm.nih.gov/SemMedDB/) that is available in PostgreSQL format.

**Download Link**: Download the `causalehr_backup.tar.gz` file from OneDrive :https://unmm-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/rajeshupadhayaya_unm_edu/ESO2UPECVk5Ku3JRSClPytMBngCV_0QN8-cA-zQRjaYogg?e=YolDZH

**Note**: The database file is approximately 25GB in size, so the download may take several minutes depending on your internet connection.

#### Database Setup Instructions

**Prerequisites:**

- PostgreSQL must be installed on your system (see the PostgreSQL installation instructions in Step 2 above)
- Sufficient disk space (at least 50GB recommended for extraction and setup)

**Create the Database:**

Replace `<username>` with your actual PostgreSQL username.

```bash
tar -xzf causalehr_backup.tar.gz
createdb -U <username> -h localhost causalehr
pg_restore -d causalehr -U <username> causalehr_backup/
```

**Note**: The CUI search index table is automatically created by the application on first use, so no additional setup is required.

### Step 4: Install Miniconda and Setup Environment

This project requires Conda for environment management. If you don't have Conda/Miniconda installed, please follow the official installation guide:

**Installation Guide**: [https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)

After installation, verify Conda is installed correctly:
```bash
conda --version
# Should display: conda 25.x.x or higher
```

#### Setup Steps

Once Miniconda is installed, follow these steps to set up the project environment:

```bash
# 1. Set up environment configuration
cp doc/sample.env .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# 2. Create a conda environment from the YAML file
conda env create -f doc/environment.yaml

# 3. Activate the environment
conda activate causalknowledgetrace

# 4. Update environment with Python dependencies
pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

# 5. Install R packages
Rscript doc/packages.R
```

**Note**: Make sure R is installed on your system before running the R package installation script.

### Step 5: Database Configuration

Before running graph creation, you need to configure your database connection:

```bash
# Copy the sample environment file
cp doc/sample.env .env

# Edit the .env file with your database credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

Edit the `.env` file with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials. Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the credentials you created during PostgreSQL installation:
```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=causalehr
DB_SCHEMA=causalehr
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=samalec
DB_PASSWORD=$hibboleth365!!!
DB_NAME=causalehr
DB_SCHEMA=causalehr
```

**Important**:

- Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials
- The `.env` file is listed in .gitignore to protect sensitive information. Changes to it are ignored by _Git_ for security purposes (since it contains sensitive information)
- Make sure your database contains the SemMedDB schema with the _causalpredication_ table

##Verify database installation:##

Open a new terminal window:
```bash
psql -U your_username

# Connect to database
\c causalehr

# Test the query
SELECT * FROM causalpredication LIMIT 5;

# Quit out of psql (PostgreSQL)
\q
```

### Step 6: Run the Application

Once all the prerequisites are installed and configured, you can launch the Shiny web application:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory, and the conda environment is activated
conda activate causalknowledgetrace

# Run the Shiny application
Rscript run_app.R
```

The application will start and open in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, look for the URL in the terminal output (typically `http://127.0.0.1:XXXX` where XXXX is the port number).

**Note**: The first time you run the application, it may take a few moments to initialize the database connections and create necessary index tables.

## CUI Search Functionality

### Enhanced Medical Concept Search

The application includes an advanced CUI (Concept Unique Identifier) search system that provides an intuitive interface for selecting medical concepts:

#### How to Use

Type at least 3 characters and press Enter to search. Click on search results to select CUIs, or manually enter them in the format C followed by 7 digits (e.g., C0020538). Selected CUIs appear as a comma-separated list that can be edited directly.

For more detail, see Usage instructions: [CKT Usage Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SOr5PCclzzkw6_R13Swf0NEyNDwJL9FUW2pQY6wafSs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Errors
**Problem:** Application fails to connect to PostgreSQL database

**Solutions:**
1. Verify PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   pg_ctl status
   
   # On Windows
   pg_isready
```

2. Check your `.env` credentials match your PostgreSQL settings
3. Ensure the `causalehr` database exists:
```bash
   psql -U your_username -l | grep causalehr
```

#### Conda Environment Issues
**Problem:** `conda activate causalknowledgetrace` fails

**Solutions:**
1. Initialize conda for your shell:
```bash
   conda init bash  # or zsh, fish, etc.
```
2. Close and reopen your terminal
3. Try activating again

**Problem:** Package installation fails in conda environment

**Solution:**
```bash
# Remove and recreate the environment
conda deactivate
conda env remove -n causalknowledgetrace
conda env create -f doc/environment.yaml
```

#### R Package Installation Errors
**Problem:** `Rscript doc/packages.R` fails

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure R is installed and accessible:
```bash
   R --version
```
2. Install packages manually in R console:
```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "visNetwork", "DT", "shinyjs"))
```

#### Application Won't Start
**Problem:** `Rscript run_app.R` fails or crashes

**Solutions:**
1. Check all prerequisites are installed (see verification commands above)
2. Ensure conda environment is activated:
```bash
   conda activate causalknowledgetrace
```
3. Check for port conflicts (default: 8080):
```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   lsof -ti:8080
   
   # If a process is using port 8080, kill it or specify a different port
```

#### Database Download Issues
**Problem:** 25GB download fails or is very slow

**Solutions:**
1. Use a stable internet connection
2. If download fails partway, try the OneDrive web interface instead of direct download
3. Verify file integrity after download:
```bash
   # File should be approximately 25GB
   ls -lh causalehr_backup.tar.gz
```

#### CUI Search Not Working
**Problem:** CUI search returns no results

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure the CUI search index table was created (check application logs on first run)
2. Try searching with different terms (at least 3 characters required)
3. Manually verify database connection in psql:
```bash
   psql -U your_username -d causalehr -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM causalehr.cui_search_index;"
```
