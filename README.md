# CausalKnowledgeTrace: Interactive DAG Visualization and Causal Knowledge Graph Generation

CausalKnowledgeTrace is a comprehensive system for interactive visualization of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and automated causal knowledge graph generation from biomedical literature. The system integrates a Shiny web application for visualization and configuration with a Python-based graph creation engine that queries SemMedDB for causal relationships.

## 📋 What This Project Does

- **🌐 Interactive Visualization**: Web-based DAG exploration with zoom, pan, and node interaction
- **🔍 Graphical Causal Modeling**: Automated assembly of causal relationships from biomedical literature given Concept Unique Identifiers in the Unified Medical Language System, or [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html), for the Exposure and Outcome of interest
- **📊 Evidence Analysis**: PMID-based evidence tracking and strength assessment
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Binary formats, caching, and vectorized operations for large graphs
- **🎯 Configurable Analysis**: Enter multiple CUIs for the exposure and/or outcome; Examine 1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree relationships
- **📁 Multiple Formats**: R DAG files, JSON assertions, optimized binary formats

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **PostgreSQL** database with modified SemMEDdb data (for graph creation) in postgres
- **Conda/Miniconda**: For environment management (required)
- **Python** (version 3.11 or higher)
- **R** (version 4.0 or higher): Download from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

### Database Requirements

- PostgreSQL database with SemMedDB schema
- Database connection parameters (host, port, username, password, database name)
- **CUI Search Index Table**: Automatically created by the application on first use

## Installation

### Step 1: PostgreSQL Database Setup for SemMedDB

#### Database Download

We created a modified version of [SemMedDB](https://skr3.nlm.nih.gov/SemMedDB/) that is available in PostgreSQL format.

**Download Link**: Download the `causalehr_backup.tar.gz` file from OneDrive :https://unmm-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/rajeshupadhayaya_unm_edu/ESO2UPECVk5Ku3JRSClPytMBngCV_0QN8-cA-zQRjaYogg?e=YolDZH

**Note**: The database file is approximately 25GB in size, so the download may take several minutes depending on your internet connection.

#### Database Setup Instructions

**Prerequisites:**

- PostgreSQL must be installed on your system
- Sufficient disk space (at least 50GB recommended for extraction and setup)

**Create the Database:**

Replace `<username>` with your actual PostgreSQL username.

```bash
tar -xzf causalehr_backup.tar.gz
createdb -U <username> -h localhost causalehr
pg_restore -d causalehr -U <username> causalehr_backup/
```

**Note**: The CUI search index table is automatically created by the application on first use, so no additional setup is required.

### Step 2: Install Miniconda and Setup Environment

This project requires Conda for environment management. If you don't have Conda/Miniconda installed, please follow the official installation guide:

**Installation Guide**: [https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)

The guide provides detailed instructions for:

- Windows
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux

After installation, verify that conda is installed correctly:

```bash
conda --version
conda info
```

#### Setup Steps

Once Miniconda is installed, follow these steps to set up the project environment:

```bash
# 1. Setup environment configuration
cp doc/sample.env .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# 2. Create conda environment from the YAML file
conda env create -f doc/environment.yaml

# 3. Activate the environment
conda activate causalknowledgetrace

# 4. Update environment with Python dependencies
pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

# 5. Install R packages
Rscript doc/packages.R
```

**Note**: Make sure R is installed on your system before running the R package installation script.

### Step 3: Database Configuration

Before running graph creation, you need to configure your database connection:

```bash
# Copy the sample environment file
cp doc/sample.env .env

# Edit the .env file with your database credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

The `.env` file should contain:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_SCHEMA=causalehr
```

**Important**:

- Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials
- The `.env` file is ignored by git for security (contains sensitive information)
- Make sure your database contains the SemMedDB schema with causalpredication table

## CUI Search Functionality

### Enhanced Medical Concept Search

The application includes an advanced CUI (Concept Unique Identifier) search system that provides an intuitive interface for selecting medical concepts:

#### How to Use

Type at least 3 characters and press Enter to search. Click on search results to select CUIs, or manually enter them in the format C followed by 7 digits (e.g., C0020538). Selected CUIs appear as a comma-separated list that can be edited directly.
