# YAML Configuration Template for CKT Graph Generation
# Copy this file and modify for your use case

# UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) for exposure variable(s)
# You can find CUIs at: https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/
exposure_cuis:
  - C0000000  # Replace with actual CUI

# UMLS CUIs for outcome variable(s)
outcome_cuis:
  - C0000000  # Replace with actual CUI

# Human-readable names for file naming
# These are used to name the output files: {exposure_name}_{outcome_name}_degree_N.R
exposure_name: ExposureName
outcome_name: OutcomeName

# Minimum number of PMIDs (publications) required for a relationship
# Higher values = more evidence required = fewer but stronger relationships
# Typical values: 10-50
min_pmids: 50

# Graph degree: how many "hops" from exposure/outcome to include
# 1 = direct connections only
# 2 = include intermediate nodes (neighbors of neighbors)
# 3 = include 2nd-degree intermediates (less common, very large graphs)
degree: 2

# Types of semantic relationships to include
# Common options:
#   CAUSES - X causes Y (most important for causal analysis)
#   STIMULATES - X stimulates/activates Y
#   PREVENTS - X prevents Y
#   INHIBITS - X inhibits/suppresses Y
#   ASSOCIATED_WITH - X is associated with Y (weaker evidence)
#   TREATS - X treats Y
#   PREDISPOSES - X predisposes to Y
predication_types:
  - CAUSES
  - STIMULATES
  - PREVENTS
  - INHIBITS

# Optional: CUIs to exclude from the graph
# Use this to block overly generic concepts that create noise
# Common blocks:
#   C0030705 - Patients
#   C0439234 - Year
#   C0039082 - Time
#   C0025663 - Measurement
blocklist_cuis: []

# Optional: Publication year range
# Uncomment to restrict to specific time periods
# start_year: 2000
# end_year: 2023
